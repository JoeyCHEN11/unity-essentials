# Unity Essentials Pathway Final Project

This is my final project developed by following the Unity Learn's official tutorial: [Unity Essentials](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials)

Specifically, I applied the knowledge I learned to build a mini game that combines all the previous scenes in the Custom Scene.
